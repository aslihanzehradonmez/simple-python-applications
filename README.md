Here’s the revised **Featured Projects** section, based on the descriptions you provided:

### 🌟 Featured Projects (First Release)

1. **Calculator** 🧮  
   A scientific calculator that performs advanced arithmetic operations like trigonometry, exponentiation, and logarithmic functions, in addition to basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

2. **Odd Even Checker** 🔢  
   This game presents random numbers, and the player has to identify whether each number is odd or even.

3. **Fibonacci Game** 🐑  
   Given a range, the player is tasked with correctly ordering the Fibonacci sequence within that range.
